# Edx Adapt XBlock

Place this XBlock at the beginning of your course so students gets registered in your edx-adapt instance for a given course before they start to solve problems.

This XBlock does two things.

1. Lets teacher configure:
    * Edx adapt API base URL,
    * Edx adapt parameters for new students,
1. Register students in the edx adapt app once they view it in the Courseware.
